<h1>The Wealth Gap in America</h1>
<h5 class="name"> By Nick Sample</h5>
<h3>What is the Issue? </h3>
  
<p class="intro"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wealth gap refers specifically to wealth and wealth inequality, which is different from income and
  income inequality. Wealth refers to the net sum of one’s assets, which can take the form of stocks, bonds,
  investments, housing equity, and more, not just income. Most importantly, wealth can be passed down much easier,
  resulting in generational wealth. The wealth gap is a systemic, growing issue that takes root in many sources, such as
  political and societal issues, that leave many in dire situations, and the misconstrued belief that the pros of
  inequality outweigh the negatives sustains this issue. </p>

<h3>Current Problems Defined</h3>
<p class="currentProblems"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the U.S., the wealth gap is an issue that is steadily increasing at a large rate, and it
  has been increasing for many years. The top 25%, espeically the top 1-10%, have been constantly growing in wealth,
  while the bottom 25% has remained relatively stagnant, even losing wealth during some periods. 
<div class="facts">
  <div class="fact1">
  The State of U.S Wealth Inequality from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis - “The top 10% of households by wealth had $6.5 million on average. As a group, they held 66.6% of total household wealth. The bottom 50% of households by wealth…held 2.6% of total household wealth” (Kent & Ricketts 2024)
</div>
  <div class="fact2">Trends in Income and Wealth Inequality from Pew Research Center - “From 2007 to 2016, the median net worth of the richest 20% increased 13%...In contrast, the net worth of families in lower tiers of wealth decreased at least 20% from 2007 to 2016. THe greatest loss– 39% – was experienced by families in the second quintile of wealth, whose wealth fell from $32,100 in 2007 to $19,500 in 2016” (Horowitz et al. 2020). </div>
  <div class="fact3">Trends in Income and Wealth Inequality from Pew Research Center - “One reason for the concern is that people in the lower rungs of the economic ladder may experience diminished economic opportunity and mobility in the face of rising inequality...Others have highlighted inequality’s negative impact on the political influence of the disadvantaged, on geographic segregation by income, and on economic growth itself” (Horowitz et al. 2020). </div>
  <div class="fact4"> Trends in Income and Wealth Inequality from Pew Research Center - “From 1983 to 2016, the share of aggregate wealth going to upper-income families increased from 60% to 79%. Meanwhile, the share held by middle-income families has been cut nearly in half, falling from 32% to 17%. Lower-income families had only 4% of aggregate wealth in 2016, down from 7% in 1983” (Horowitz et al. 2020). </div>

<h3>Causes</h3>
<p class="causes"> 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Issues in the government affect and contribute directly to the wealth gap through lobbying. Lobbying is a practice in which companies, groups, or individuals try to influence policy makers through some fashion, usually through understood bribery. These people are called lobbyists because of their tendency to be in lobbies until given a chance to speak with a policy maker and bribe them. These groups and individuals choose to spend their money lobbying the government so that they are able to uphold their practices that are able to help these groups maintain and expand their vast wealth. Every year, billions of dollars are spent by a multitude of industries hoping to gain favor and maintain their accumulated wealth. </p>
  <p class="causes"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The common notion that the negatives of inequality are “worth it” for the growth inequality brings is extremely ignorant to how serious and detrimental the problem of the wealth gap has become. Many people beleive that the wealth gap exists because some people work harder than others, that the wealth gap is justified due to it being legal, that the wealth gap is fine when there is equal opportunity, or that the wealth gap triggers beneficial events for all. Though these all seem valid, there are counterarguments to them all that are just as valid. First, the rich today do not have to work hard for their money. Generational wealth, the passing down of wealth from one generation to the next, displays how some people are born rich and others are born poor, un-evening the playing field from Day 1.  Second, the legality of this issue is questionable, as seen in lobbying and politicians being bribed. Third, equal opportunity does not exist in America, as seen in issues concerning race and systemic, generational injustices. Finally, the argument that inequality produces growth for the economy may not be all that true, proven in countless economic studies.

<h3>Connecting Issues</h3>
<p class="connectingIssues">
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wealth inequality has many different sources and can vary from place to place, based on things such as race, gender, education, and/or established government, which are all factors that are hard to be changed by those without power or money. Though presented as simply an economic issue, the true roots of wealth inequality reach many other issues in society, which add to the toughness of getting rid of the issue. The wealth gap between the rich and poor can be extended even further when comparing, for example, a rich white man and a poor Hispanic, Black, or Native American woman. If poor people were already being put in an endless cycle of poverty, imagine the additional difficulties a poor Black or Hispanic family may be facing in today's society. When discussing the wealth gap, simply addressing how to close the gap between income classes is not enough. It is also absolutely necessary to discuss closing the wealth gap between the races as well, especially considering how this gap between the races has a deep history interconnected with racism's history, sexism's history, and these problems' permeating effects today.</p>
  <h3>Solutions</h3>
  <p class="solutions"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is clear that the wealth gap is a large problem for America and the world itself. The problem of wealth inequality has grown to the point of being a systemic issue, causing generational cycles of inescapable poverty and awful situations. This has large ties to racial, gender, and political problems, making the issue even harder to solve. Personally, I believe this issue is talked about a good amount in the present day, but no action is being done. No one is able to fight back against these big companies without being hurt greatly, as seen in the Boeing whistleblower case. It is an absolutely horrifying present day we live in where we are being led by politicians who simply echo the opinions of major companies. To me, the only way to fight against this problem is activism and politcal action, as scary as that may be.</p>
